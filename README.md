# Promises-in-JS
 Promises in JavaScript are used for handling asynchronous operations. Promises provide a cleaner alternative to callback-based asynchronous code in JS

 The repository includes a simple example demonstrating the creation and usage of Promises in JavaScript.


 Usage
To use Promises in your JavaScript code:

Create a new Promise using the Promise constructor.
Inside the Promise executor function, perform your asynchronous operation.
Call resolve(value) when the operation is successful, passing the resulting value.
Call reject(error) if the operation fails, passing an error object.
Chain .then() to handle the resolved value and .catch() to handle errors.
